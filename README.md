# Image Caption Flickr Dataset with PyTorch

This repository is still under construction.

This repository is created to show how to make neural network using pytorch to generate a caption from an image. The dataset that I use in this repository is Flickr8k and Flikcr30k Image Caption dataset. The model is divided into encoder and decoder to make it more clear to read the code.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository


2. Download the dataset


3. Train the model


4. Test the model



## Flickr Dataset Source
The dataset that I use for this repository can be downloaded from this dataset repository :

Flickr8k Dataset  : https://www.kaggle.com/nunenuh/flickr8k <br/>
Flickr30k Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/nunenuh/flickr30k

This dataset is in my data repository at kaggle, I change the dataset from original dataset to match what I need in this repository
