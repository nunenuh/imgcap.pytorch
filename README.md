# Image Caption With PyTorch

This repository is still under construction.

This repository is created to show how to make neural network using pytorch to generate a caption from an image. The dataset that I use in this repository is Flickr8k and Flikcr30k Image Caption dataset. The model is divided into encoder and decoder to make it more clear to read the code.

The image on the top is the ilustration of the network, but not very similar to what I do in this project, that image is just only the illustration of what the network do. <br/>




## Project Structure
asda

## Usage
1. Clone the repository


2. Download the dataset


3. Train the model


4. Test the model



## Flickr Dataset Source
The dataset that I use for this repository can be downloaded from this dataset repository :

Flickr8k Dataset  : https://www.kaggle.com/nunenuh/flickr8k <br/>
Flickr30k Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/nunenuh/flickr30k

This dataset is in my data repository at kaggle, I change the dataset from original dataset to match what I need in this repository
